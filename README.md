### Scenario:
A customer should be able to log in on our website. (The actual Website is not needed.)
Therefore they receive a Magic Link after they commissioned an order via Email. With this
Magic Link they can set their initial password.

### Task:
Build the following Pages based on ReactJS and the usual related patterns:
- Account activation page (the page where a customer gets after opening the Magic Link
URL and where they can set their initial password)
- Login page (the page where customers can login after they defined their password
initially)
- Password Reset page (after entering their Email, the users should see a Magic Link
where they can change their password)
- Account Dashboard (basically an empty Page with "Welcome, <username>!" Header)

The access to the dashboard should be restricted, as long as they havenâ€™t logged in properly.
The account activation for an active user should lead to the request to login (on the normal
Login Page)
